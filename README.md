# VIP-python-client

This module is used to communicate with the VIP API using the Python
language.
This is a synchronous implementation.

## How to use it

This module works like a state machine: first, set the `apikey` with
`setApiKey(str)`. All the functions will refer to this `apikey` later.

You can also set the certificate for VIP with `setCertifPath(str)`. By default,
the script will look at its location for a `'[...]/certif.crt'` file.
You should already have a certificate when cloning this project from git. If
it's not the case you can get it with your browser [on VIP](http://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/). 
Get the chained one.

You can now use all of the functions :blush:

## Raised errors

If there are any VIP issues, functions will raise *RuntimeError* errors. See
`detect\_errors` and `manage\_errors` functions if you want to change this.

## Improvement

- an asynchronous version
- missing a few optional parameters for some functions (not important)

# VipSession

[vip-portal]: https://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/ "https://vip.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/"

*Python client for the VIP API.*

## Introduction

### Main Goal

This Python class launches pipeline executions on the Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP) from one's personal computer. It should work on both Windows and Unix-based systems.

Running a pipeline on VIP implies the following process: 

*Upload one's Dataset on VIP servers* **>>** *Run the Pipeline* **>>** *Download the Pipeline Results from VIP servers*.

This is summarized in the diagram below.

<img src="imgs/Upload_Run_Download.png" alt="Procedure" height="250" title="The Upload-Run-Download Procedure"/>

A VipSession instance (hereafter named: *Session*) performs this procedure in a few simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- VipSession uses the [VIP API](./vip.py), making calls to [Python's Request Library](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). This may require installing this library on your computer:
```
pip install requests
```

- Communication with VIP requires a valid API key. 
See [below](#get-a-vip-api-key) how to get your own key in a few steps.

## Get Started

### Session Inputs

A single Session allows you to run __1 pipeline__ on __1 dataset__ with __1 parameter set__. 
Therefore, a Session is defined with at least three inputs:

1. `pipeline_id` (*str*, **required**): The name of your pipeline on VIP. 
    - *Usually in the format: *application_name*/*version**.
2. `input_dir` (*str*, **required**): the local path to your dataset (*e.g.* '$HOME/project/data').
    - *This directory will be uploaded on VIP before launching the pipeline.*
3. `input_settings` (*dict*, **required**) All parameters needed to run the pipeline.
    - *See the pipeline description for more information*.

When a Session is created, two optional inputs can be provided to improve the user experience:

4. `session_name` (*str*, **optional**) A name to identify this session and the corresponding results. 
    - *Default value: 'session_[date]_[time]'*
5. `output_dir` (*str*, **optional**) Local path to the directory where pipeline outputs will be downloaded from VIP servers.
    - *Default value: './vip_outputs/`session_name`'*

Inputs 4 & 5 should be unique: they cannot be shared with another Session. Inputs 1 to 5 are a Session's main **properties** they fully define its behavior throughout the Upload-Run-Download procedure.

In addition, VipSession methods accept specific arguments (like `verbose` or `nb_runs`) to fine-tune their behavior. 
See VipSession documentation for detailed information. 

Finally, connection with VIP requires a valid [API key](#get-a-vip-api-key). 
This requirement is not bound to a given Session.

0. `api_key` (*str*, **required**): your VIP API key.
    - *The string value can take several forms. See `VipSession.init()` for detailed information.*

### Basic Steps
Once a connection with VIP is established (*stage 0*), the Upload-Run-Download procedure is achieved through six elementary steps:

1. **Start** a `VipSession`
2. **Upload** the inputs
3. **Launch** the pipeline
4. **Monitor** the pipeline's workflow
5. **Download** the outputs
6. **Finish** the `VipSession` by removing your data (inputs & outputs) from the VIP servers
   
Each step has a dedicated method.
```python
from utils.VipSession import VipSession

# 0. Connect with VIP
VipSession.init(api_key=...)  
# One call applies to multiple Sessions (until connection is lost).

# 1. Create a Session
session = VipSession(session_name=...)
# 2. Upload your data on VIP servers
session.upload_inputs(input_dir=...)
# 3. Launch a pipeline on VIP
session.launch_pipeline(pipeline_id=..., input_settings=...)
# 4. Monitor its progress on VIP until all executions are over 
session.monitor_workflows()
# 5. Download the outputs from VIP servers when all executions are over
session.download_outputs()
# 6. Remove the data from VIP servers (inputs and outputs)
session.finish()
```

In this typical piece of code, `VipSession`'s [properties](#session-inputs "VipSession Inputs") (`session_name`, `input_dir`, *etc.*) are progressively passed as inputs during steps 1, 2 & 3. They can also be defined at instantiation (i.e., step 1 or even step 0: see [below](#use-session-shortcuts "Session Shortcuts")). Once set, a property cannot be modified. 

### Session Outputs

When running a Session for the first time, a directory (`output_dir`) is made to store the pipeline results and the Session backup file.
By default, this `output_dir` is `./vip_outputs/session_name`.

#### Session Backup
At the end of steps 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6, session properties (*e.g.*, `session_name`, `pipeline_id`) are automatically saved in a JSON file (*session_data.json*).
This backup can be used to [resume a finished or running Session][resume].

[resume]: #resume-your-session "Resume your Session"

#### Pipeline Results
The `download_outputs()` procedure stores the pipeline results on your machine. If the VIP implementation of the pipeline yields a tarball (`*\*.tar.gz*`), its content is extracted (by default) and the archive is removed from your machine.

When a single job\* is submitted to VIP, the pipeline results are stored in `output_dir` mirroring their structure on VIP servers: 

```
.
├── 02-02-2023_09:21:23
│   └── results.tgz
│       ├── file_x
│       └── file_y
└── session_data.json
```

In this file tree:
- Pipeline results correspond to `file_x` & `file_y`.
- `results.tgz` gathers the job's results (\*).
    - If the VIP implementation of the pipeline yields a tarball, `results.tgz` is a folder bearing the same name.
- *02-02-2023_09:21:23* is named after the starting time of the workflow (\*).

(\*) See [below](#jobs-and-workflows "Jobs and Workflows") for detailed information about jobs and workflows.

## Best Practices

[steps]: #basic-steps "Basic Steps"

### Use Session Shortcuts

Session properties can be declared at instantiation:
```python
session = VipSession(session_name=..., input_dir=..., pipeline_id=..., input_settings=..., ouput_dir=...)
```

This can be combined with a VIP connection ([steps 0 & 1][steps]) through `VipSession.init()`:
Once a connection is established and Session inputs are set, 
the **upload-run-download** process ([steps 2->5][steps]) can be performed by `run_session()`:
```python
session.run_session()
```

Do not forget to remove your data from VIP servers once the download is complete:
```python
session.finish()
```

All methods can be run in cascade, so the whole procedure holds on a single line :
```python
VipSession.init(api_key=..., input_dir=..., [...]).run_session().finish()
```

### Resume your Session

A Session is backed up after every step. 
To load data from an old Session, instantiate it with its output directory (`ouput_dir`):
```python
session = VipSession(output_dir='./vip_outputs/old_session')
```
If `ouput_dir` is the default (like above), **simply provide the `session_name`**:
```python
session = VipSession('old_session') # Equivalent to: session = VipSession(session_name='old_session')
```

This backup/restore system is useful to:
- [Run the *Upload-Run-Download* process intermittently][progress], without a dedicated variable ; 
- [Relaunch the same procedure][finished], after the Session has been "finished".

[progress]: #resume-a-session-in-progress "Resume a Session in Progress"
[finished]: #relaunch-a-finished-session "Relaunch a Finished Session"

#### Resume a Session in Progress

For instance, some pipeline runs can take hours or days. 
These runs should be monitored on the [VIP portal](vip-portal) while turning off your Python interpreter. 
Using an identifiable `session_name`, the procedure can be left at any time and resumed with an identical Session object.
```python
# Connect with VIP
VipSession.init(api_key=...)
# Start a Session with a new name and upload your dataset
VipSession("my_session").upload_inputs(input_dir=...)
# When the upload is over, launch the pipeline 
VipSession("my_session").launch_pipeline(pipeline_id=..., input_settings=...)
# 
# You can exit your Python interpreter and monitor the pipeline execution on VIP website.
# 
# When the execution is over, connect with VIP again and download the outputs
VipSession.init(api_key=..., session_name="my_session").download_ouputs()
# When the download is over, remove your data from VIP servers
VipSession("my_session").finish()
```
Unlike our [first examples][get-started], here the `VipSession` is run without a dedicated variable by using the session name: `VipSession("my_session")`.
This is possible because a personalized `session_name` was set, but no personalized `output_dir`. If for some reason a personalized `output_dir` is set, the session can be resumed only by typing: `VipSession(output_dir=...)`.

[get-started]: #get-started "Get Started"

#### Relaunch a Finished Session

Finally, a `VipSession` can also be resumed after running the `finish()` method.
For example, to display a short report about your pipeline runs:
```python
VipSession("my_session").monitor_workflows()
```

The same `VipSession` can be used to relaunch a full *Upload-Run-Download* procedure with the same inputs:
```python
# Connect with VIP
VipSession.init(api_key=...)
# Relaunch the full procedure & finish
VipSession("my_session").run_session().finish()
```

In that case, the new pipeline outputs will be downloaded next to the older ones.

This feature can be used to run repeatability experiments on one's successful pipeline executions.

### Parallelize your Pipeline Runs with VIP

#### Illustration

In a `VipSession`'s output directory (`output_dir`), the file tree presented [above](#pipeline-results "Pipeline Results") can be generalized as below:
```
.
├── Workflow_1
│   ├── Job_A
│   │   ├── file_x
│   │   └── file_y
│   └── Job_B
│       ├── file_x
│       └── file_y
├── Workflow_2
│   ├── Job_A
│   │   ├── file_x
... ... ...
└── session_data.json
```

#### Jobs and Workflows

In this file tree:
- Pipeline results correspond to *file_x*, *file_y*;
- *Job_A* gathers the results of a single pipeline run;
- *Workflow_1* gathers the results of multiple jobs.

A **job** is a single task run by the pipeline on VIP, *e.g.* with a single input file and parameter set.
One can submit multiple jobs in parallel, *e.g.* run the pipeline on multiple files and parameter sets at the same time. 
This can be achieved by providing *lists* of files or parameters in the `input_settings`.

From a `VipSession`'s point of view, a **workflow** is a collection of jobs submitted on the same `pipeline_id` with the same `input_settings`. 
Again, one `VipSession` can launch multiple workflows (\*); by calling `launch_pipeline()` several times, by increasing its optional argument `nb_runs`, or by [re-starting the session](#relaunch-a-finished-session) after it was "finished". Multiple workflows can also run in parallel on VIP.

(\*) To run simultaneous workflows with your VIP account, please contact <vip-support@creatis.insa-lyon.fr> to increase your execution capacity (1 by default).*

#### In a Nutshell

VIP pipelines can be run on massive datasets by submitting jobs in parallel.
- A **single job** is submitted on VIP when `launch_pipeline()` is called and `input_settings` are filled with a single value for each parameter;
- A **single workflow** can be used to run **multiple jobs** in parallel, by providing a list of values for some parameters in the `input_settings`;
- A **single Session** can be used to run **multiple workflows** in parallel, on the same `pipeline_id` with the same `input_settings`;
- **Multiple Sessions** can be used to run **multiple workflows** in parallel, with multiple `pipeline_id` and `input_settings`.

Clever use of multiple Sessions in parallel is detailed below.

### Run Multiple Sessions on the Same Dataset

As stated [above][get-started], 1 Session allows to run 1 pipeline on 1 dataset with 1 parameter set. 
To run a pipeline with *several parameter sets*, or *several pipelines* on the same dataset, one has to start several sessions:
```python
# Session Inputs
my_dataset = "./data" 
settings_A = ... # First parameter set
settings_B = ... # Second parameter set
# Connect to VIP
VipSession.init(api_key=...)
# Run Session A with settings A and finish
session_a = VipSession(input_dir=my_dataset, pipeline_id=..., input_settings=settings_A
).run_session().finish()
# Run Session B with settings B and finish
session_b = VipSession(input_dir=my_dataset, pipeline_id=..., input_settings=settings_B
).run_session().finish()
```

By default, **each dataset uploaded on VIP is bound to a single Session**. In the above example, `my_dataset` is thus **uploaded twice** on VIP servers (and removed twice at the end), as depicted in the diagram below.

<img src="imgs/VipSession_without_get_inputs.png" alt="without_get_inputs" height="250" title="Two VIP Sessions without get_inputs()"/>

Unlike the previous example, **using `get_inputs()` allows a Session to reuse the inputs of another**:
```python
session_b.get_inputs(session_a)
```

`get_inputs()` is meant to replace `upload_inputs()` during [Step 2][steps] of the *Upload-Run-Download* procedure. Bearing this in mind, the previous example could be rewritten this way:

```python
# Run Session A
session_a = VipSession(input_dir=my_dataset, pipeline_id=..., input_settings=settings_A
).run_session() # Do not run `finish()` until the entire process is over.
# Create Session B using the same inputs as Session A
session_b = VipSession(pipeline_id=..., input_settings=settings_B)
session_b.get_inputs(session_a)
# Run Session B and finish
session_b.run_session().finish()
# Finish Session A
session_a.finish()
```

By default, running `finish()` on Session B will not remove its inputs (i.e., `my_dataset`) from VIP servers, because they belong to Session A (see the diagram below). This behavior can be modified by setting `force_remove`=True.

<img src="imgs/VipSession_with_get_inputs.png" alt="with_get_inputs" height="220" title="Two VIP Sessions with get_inputs()"/>

Besides saving memory on VIP servers, **clever use of input data can save a lot of time**, since there is no easy way to parallelize the upload and download steps between multiple sessions.

## Improvements

Short term features
- Use of `pathlib` everywhere in the code for better maintenance
- Launch pipelines with Girder files

To improve user experience
- Function `describe_pipeline()` to help novice users shape the `input_settings`` property
- Function `get()` to easily get undeclared properties (`session_name`, `output_dir`) from a Session object
